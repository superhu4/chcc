    <h1>2025 Ministers Collective</h1>

    <p>On May 6-8, 2025, we invite you to join us at the Chinese Heritage Church Ministers Collective in Dallas, TX. This is a gathering for those called to serve and engage the Chinese heritage church, particularly in the English speaking ministries. This gathering is a collection of those serving and we pray that participants would be encouraged not so much by content, but more so by connection with others serving in Chinese heritage churches.</p>
    
    <p><i>Registration opens on February 1, 2025.</i></p>

  <p>Tim Lo is all about straight A's: Academically-Achieving, Affluence-Aspiring, Asian-American Adolescents. He's passionate about helping parents raise these kids in understanding how their unique identity connects with the gospel of Jesus Christ, enabling them to influence others and impact the world for good.</p>
  <p>Tim's parents are from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and he graduated from Wheaton College and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He's been a full-time youth pastor in various Chinese churches (NJ, MA, CA) since 2002.</p>
  <p>Strictly for his job, Tim has consumed over 1,000 boba drinks and 1,000 slices of pizza. At the time of this writing, he's on break from Instagram (10+ years) and Brawl (35,000+ trophies). Every week, he spends a 40 hour period of time off devices for his mental health. Sometimes he'll also joke with people that he's "busy" because of his weekly "board meeting" (skateboarding by the beach). Tim currently serves as one of the youth pastors at the Chinese Bible Church of San Diego. He is married and has three kids.</p>
