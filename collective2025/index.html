    <p>On May 6-8, 2025, we invite you to join us at the Chinese Heritage Church Ministers Collective in Dallas, TX. This is a gathering for those called to serve and engage the Chinese heritage church, particularly in the English speaking ministries. This gathering is a collection of those serving and we pray that participants would be encouraged not so much by content, but more so by connection with others serving in Chinese heritage churches.</p>

    <h2>Presentations</h2>
    <p><strong>Five Plenary Session Topics along Partnership with the Chinese Heritage Church</strong></p>
    <p>We call our gathering a Ministers Collective because it's more a collection of ministers than it is a conference. And this is reflected in how we designed our five main plenary sessions.</p>
    <p>Many conferences offer outstanding content and speakers. Yet in the Ministers Collective, we hope you leave not only with good content, but good connections with others who are ministering in Chinese heritage churches.</p>
    <p>That's why in a 90 minute plenary session, participants will have the opportunity to discuss at table groups the various themes of this year's gathering.</p>
    <p>Think of the two 10 minute presentations at the start of each plenary session as a sort of "setting the table" for your own table group to discuss. You won't be assigned tables, as we trust you can find your own seats. And we hope that after you hear our presenters share briefly, it will open opportunities for you to share and pray at your tables with one another.</p>
    <p>Our theme for this year's Ministers Collective is "Partnership with the Chinese Heritage Church."</p>

    <h3>Surprising Partnership with the Chinese Heritage Church</h3>
    <p><em>Andrew Bywaters and Raj Christodoss</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    	<p>One of the reasons we find the term "Chinese heritage church" helpful is that it seems odd to call our churches "Chinese churches" especially when we have folks that do not identify ethnically or culturally as Chinese. This is all the more relevant when the non-Chinese persons in the Chinese heritage church are those pastoring them!</p>
        <p>In this session, we hear from two pastors whom God has called into years of ministry in Chinese heritage churches. We believe that many who are now serving and will serve in the Chinese heritage church may come from outside the Chinese people. We thank the Lord for raising up workers for the harvest, and who faithfully follow God's leading to a surprising partnership with the Chinese heritage church.</p>

    <h3>Partnering Across Life Stages in the Chinese Heritage Church</h3>
    <p><em>Jon Mann and Faith Chang</em></p>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>Singleness in the Chinese heritage church. Spouses of the ministers in the Chinese heritage church. These are just two of many life stages in which we may find ourselves while we seek to love and serve the Chinese heritage church. Perhaps all churches struggle with this, but perhaps there are unique challenges for Chinese heritage churches.</p>
    <p>In this session, we hear from a pastor who is single and we also hear from the spouse of a minister. Perhaps their sharing will encourage us to reflect and discuss about how our churches can continue to become churches where people from various life stages can come, grow, worship, and serve.</p>

    <h3>Parachurch and Chinese Heritage Church Partnerships</h3>
    <p><em>Katie Luc and Jonathan Lê</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>When churches and parachurch ministries partner together, it can be an amazing work of God! Yet there can also be challenges, especially in ethnic heritage churches such as Chinese heritage churches. What is it like for parachurch workers to relate to Chinese heritage churches? How can we further the partnership between us?</p>
    <p>In this session, we hear from parachurch workers who are engaging with Chinese heritage churches. May this session spur us on to greater partnerships!</p>

    <h3>Partnering with OBC in the Chinese Heritage Church</h3>
    <p><em>Jalon Chan and Ben Pun</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you ask many English-speaking ministers, one of the greatest challenges has been learning how to partner well with our brothers and sisters who are in the Chinese-speaking ministries. Many of us call these our Overseas Born Chinese (OBC) brothers and sisters.</p>
    <p>In this session, we will hear and consider how God both challenges and blesses our churches through leaning into deeper partnerships with Overseas brethren. We affirm we need one another. What are some different ways we can manifest and live out this mutuality? How can we continue to move forward together in partnership for the gospel?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Struggles to Be Faithful in the Chinese Heritage Church</h3>
    <p><em>Steven Chin and Tim Lo</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>To minister or pastor a church is a high and challenging calling. Sometimes it's easy to blame the "Chinese-ness" of Chinese heritage churches for problems. But in reality, all churches struggle. And yet, there are perhaps some unique struggles to faithfully minister in a Chinese heritage church in the midst of a majority white context.</p>
    <p>In this session, two pastors set the stage for our table discussions by sharing from their experiences on the journey of seeking to be faithful in serving the Chinese heritage church.</p>

    <p>Tim loves how adolescents are full of volatility and potential. He's been a youth pastor in Chinese heritage churches (Boston, New Jersey, and southern California) since 2002. He spends a lot of his time in the teenage world, but also cares deeply about listening to parents, networking and equipping other adults that work with youth, and building bridges into the non-church and non-Asian community. The lifelong theme of Tim's life is "not living up to his potential", but he's often reminded that he should only seek approval from the Lord (1 Corinthians 4:3-4).</p>
