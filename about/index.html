    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
      <p>The Chinese Heritage Church (CHC) Collaborative is just that: a
      collaboration among ministers from Chinese heritage churches. A group of
      English speaking pastors gathered in Boston in May 2019 to connect and
      see if they might find value in further developing relationships.</p>
      <p>After that 2019 Pastors Colloquium, those pastors decided they would
      be willing to meet again and see where God leads. A second Pastors
      Colloquium was scheduled for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic happened
      and plans were altered. But after two online Colloquiums, the pastors
      agreed to name an Executive Team and commissioned two foundational
      papers to be written. Producing those two papers would provide the
      opportunity for this group to clarify our thinking and to invite others
      to dialogue about what we were doing. One paper is about the history and
      thinking behind the term “Chinese heritage church.” Another paper served
      as an opportunity to make a positive case for how God is using ethnic
      heritage churches like the Chinese heritage church. You can find those
      papers on this website. After the papers were written and received
      approval from the pastors, the group commissioned the Executive Team to
      work on our first public gathering. That first public gathering would
      become known as our first Ministers Collective.</p>
      <p>The initial group of pastors was invited by a small steering team of
      pastors. We simply looked around the English speaking world and invited
      friends and colleagues we had met along the way from the USA, Canada,
      and Europe.</p>
      <p>For now, those on the Executive Team sense there may be significant
      value to encourage and offer ways for ministers in Chinese heritage
      churches to connect. Perhaps this little adventure will conclude after
      our first public event. Or, perhaps the Lord would lead us to continue
      in various initiatives. Only the Lord knows!</p>

    <h2 id="what-we-believe">What We Believe</h2>
      <p>Because we’re committed to serving Chinese heritage churches across
      various denominations and theological traditions, we approach
      collaboration from a center-bounded mindset. That means we can accept
      differences in belief and practice so long as we are centered on the
      orthodox truths of the Christian faith and a shared vision for the
      Chinese heritage church.</p>
      <p>Our understanding of Christian orthodoxy can be summarized in ancient
      creeds like the Apostles’ and Nicene or in modern formulations like
      Christiany Today’s Statement of Faith (see below). And our shared vision
      for the mission of the Chinese heritage church is captured in our
      organization’s Foundational Papers.</p>
      <p>Anyone who can readily affirm the following Statement of Faith and
      our Foundational Papers can benefit from the relationships and resources
      provided by this Collaborative.</p>

    <h3 id="statement-of-faith-christianity-today">Statement of Faith
    (Christianity Today)</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>The sixty-six canonical books of the Bible as originally written were
      inspired of God, hence free from error. They constitute the only
      infallible guide in faith and practice.</li>
        <li>There is one God, the Creator and Preserver of all things, infinite
      in being and perfection. He exists eternally in three Persons: the
      Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are of one substance and equal
      in power and glory.</li>
        <li>God created Adam and Eve in his own image. By disobedience, they fell
      from their sinless state through the temptation by Satan. This fall
      plunged humanity into a state of sin and spiritual death, and brought
      upon the entire race the sentence of eternal death. From this condition
      we can be saved only by the grace of God, through faith, on the basis of
      the work of Christ, and by the agency of the Holy Spirit.</li>
      <li>The eternally pre-existent Son became incarnate without human father,
      by being born of the Virgin Mary. Thus, in the Lord Jesus Christ, divine
      and human natures were united in one Person, both natures being whole,
      perfect, and distinct. To effect salvation, he lived a sinless life and
      died on the cross as the sinner’s substitute, shedding his blood for the
      remission of sins. On the third day he rose from the dead in the body
      which had been laid in the tomb. He ascended to the right hand of the
      Father, where he performs the ministry of intercession. He shall come
      again, personally and visibly, to complete his saving work and to
      consummate the eternal plan of God.</li>
      <li>The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Triune God. He applies to
      man the work of Christ. By justification and adoption we are given a
      right standing before God; by regeneration, sanctification, and
      glorification our nature is renewed.</li>
      <li>When we have turned to God in penitent faith in the Lord Jesus
      Christ, we are accountable to God for living a life separated from sin
      and characterized by the fruit of the Spirit. It is our responsibility
      to contribute by word and deed to the universal spread of the Gospel.</li>

      <li>At the end of the age, the bodies of the dead shall be raised. The
      righteous shall enter into full possession of eternal bliss in the
      presence of God, and the wicked shall be condemned to eternal death.</li>
