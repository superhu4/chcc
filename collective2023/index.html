<h1>2023 Ministers Collective</h1>
</div>
<div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained">
    <p>On May 2-4, 2023, we invite you to join us at the Chinese Heritage Church Ministers Collective in Houston, TX. This is a gathering for those called to serve and engage the Chinese heritage church, particularly in the English speaking ministries. This gathering is a collection of those serving and we pray that participants would be encouraged not so much by content, but more so by connection with others serving in Chinese heritage churches.</p>

    <p>Reverend Barry Gin was raised in the suburbs of Chicago and was formerly a mechanical engineer before going into ministry. It was during his college days at MIT that Barry felt the desire to serve the Lord full-time as a pastor instead of as an engineer. Because he also felt that it was beneficial to spend a few years getting real-world experience, he worked as a mechanical engineer for Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles, CA after receiving his Bachelor&#8217;s and Master&#8217;s degrees. He later enrolled into seminary and received his Master of Theology (ThM) from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1996. While attending seminary, he started the English ministry at Plano Chinese Alliance Church and later served full-time as their English Pastor. He began serving as the English Adult Pastor at Living Water Evangelical Church in January of 2013. He and his wife Christine have been married since 2003. They have two daughters, Xara and Keoni. Besides serving the church and being with his family, he enjoys music, all kinds of sports (especially golf and volleyball), playing with his Apple computers, and using coupons galore.</p>

    <p>Pastor Gaylord Tsuei joined the Pastoral Staff of Austin Chinese Church in May of 1998 as the English Pastor. In 2021, his role was adjusted and he now serves as the English and Caring Pastor of ACC. Gaylord graduated from Bob Jones University with a B.A. in Christian Missions (1988), and completed his Master of Divinity at Central Baptist Theological Seminary (1996). Previous to moving to Texas, he served at the Twin City Chinese Christian Church near Roseville, MN from 1989-1998 as the Youth Director and eventually transitioned to being their English Pastor. &#8220;PG&#8221; is married to Tina, and they have two children, Charis and Silas. Gaylord and Tina have a special burden for the 2nd and 3rd generation Chinese-Americans. They desire to see God use them to encourage others to grow in their walk with Christ and to serve God faithfully.</p>

    <p>Reverend Rocky Chan is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church of Endicott, NY. My entire church experience up to the quarantine had been the Chinese church. I was raised in a Chinese church. I pastored in two Chinese churches for a combined twenty-one years. In 2021, I was invited to pastor a church where my wife Minna and I were the only Chinese people. Interestingly, in some ways it was a cultural transition but in other ways it was not. Find me and we can chat about it.</p>
